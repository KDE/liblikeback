 * Added functions.inc.php with validStatuses(), validTypes() and
 maybeStrip().
 * Started using these three functions throughout the code.
 * Added two (production-safe) warnings to functions.php (yes, the other
 functions file).
 * Added db_fetchAll() function to fetch all objects returned by a query, and 
 used it in view.php.
 * Added db_buildQuery_checkArray() function to build the conditional part of
 a query based on an element name and an array of possible values.
 * Revised the way view.php creates a conditional query using
 db_buildQuery_checkArray().
 * Implemented a version split in send.php: '2.0beta1-svn (4658 >= 20090421)'
 is split up in fullVersion (that string) and version='2.0beta1-svn'.
 * Made send.php use validTypes() too.
 * Added upgrade script to upgrade the LikeBack table and all contents to the
 version/fullVersion system, and modified install script to allow that from
 the start.
 * Fixed install.php to detect if installation already ran.

2009-04-21 (dazjorz)
 * Correctly templatized version, locale, status and type choosing in viewfilters.tpl.
 * Removed old piece of code from view.php (ajax-related, so it's in ajax.php
 now)

 * Exported comment view to a Smarty template.
 * Templatized (that word was just made up by Valerio) the remarks display and
 the newremarks form.
 * Templatized the options page.
 * Fixed comment.php not setting developer correctly.
 * Added install.php checking if a LikeBack table exists and dieing if there
 is one, for safety.
 * Made getSmartyObject() put all of $developer in Smarty, instead of just the
 login name, and made the $developer argument compulsatory.
 * Fixed warning in view.php.
 * (Awfully) templatized the filtering options in view.php, and moved them from the
 header bar to above the items.
 * Moved the AJAX stuff in view.php to ajax.php.
 * Made options.php the file to save options, not view.php.
 * Added stub sendMailTo function to functions.php to easily fix it later if
 it's needed.
 * Fixed the viewfilters.tpl file: it didn't have a <form> tag, it does now.
 * Fixed view.php: it had a <form> tag (see above) and a non-closed header p
 tag.
 * Fixed a double escape in header.php.
 * Removed warning in options.php.
 * Templatized the bottom of all pages.
 * Removed noRemark flag for comments without remarks, it did nothing.
 * Templatized the status menu, the likeback header and the sub-bar.
 * Fully templatized the comment table in view.php.
 * Fixed bug in newremark.tpl where the page wouldn't be set over remark adds.
 * Added smarty wrappers for iconForType and iconForStatus.

 * Added LIKEBACK_PROJECT and LIKEBACK_VERSION to the configuration.
 * Fixed placeholder handling when the replaced string contains a question
 mark, and added warnings if the args string has a wrong number of elements.

 correctly.
 * Made send.php use the new escaping mechanism too.
