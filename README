This is the server backend of KMess Likeback. It is released under the GNU General Public License 2.0.

Likeback was originally included in BasKet Note Pads. It was ported to KDE4 by Valerio Pilo. This folder
contains only the backend of Likeback, heavily modified by Sjors Gielen.

Dependencies:
* Smarty - The template parsing library
* PHP 5 (5.2.0 will do)

Installation:
* Install the Smarty library.
* Put the Likeback directory in a publicly accessible location.
* Restrict access to admin/ by HTTP authentication.
* Copy db.conf.template.php to db.conf.php and modify it to your liking.
* Run admin/install.php.
* Add a crontab entry to run cron/sendReminders.php weekly (see cron/crontab).
* Test your installation.

To upgrade from 1.1, run admin/upgrade11to12.php, then add a crontab entry as above.
