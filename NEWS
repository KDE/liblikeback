Changes between LikeBack 1.3 and 1.2:
--------------------------------------
- Added the concept of a "Resolution" - All statuses which previously meant the
bug was done (Thanks, Solved, etc) are now "Closed", and a Resolution is set.
- Added the LikeBack frontend.
- Added remark flags for "e-mail sent to user" and "status changed to ...",
instead of the previous behaviour of embedding them as strings in the remark.
- Added bug triaging to Trac, including signals from Trac back to LikeBack to
close a comment. A LikeBackPlugin to Trac is available.
- Added the new bug changing system: now, the options that are available for
changing a bugs' status are shown in an easier way, which makes it much easier
to manage bugs.
- Changed the subject of all e-mails sent out by LikeBack to start with the
likebackMailSubject as set in the configuration.
- Fixed some encoding issues.
- Fixed some cache issues.
- Many more code and layout cleanups and bugfixes (see ChangeLog for a list).

Changes between LikeBack 1.2 and 1.1:
--------------------------------------
- Added a script which is supposed to be run through cron, to send developers weekly reminders of unclosed comments.
- Added an application logo, preferences and login username box and LikeBack logo to the top bar.
- Added two new statuses: Thanks (about the same as Solved) and Wontfix (about the same as Invalid).
- Added version split code in send.php, so SVN releases become a lot easier to manage in the comment list on view.php.
- Added a real layout and useful information in stats.php and added a link in the header.
- Exported many more HTML pages to Smarty templates.
- E-mails sent by the application have more correct From, Sender and Reply-To headers.
- Fixed install.php to check if it should really install (is there not already a LikeBack table?)
- Moved code around to make it more logical: Ajax code in ajax.php and option saving code in options.php, not view.php.
- Streamlined Smarty initialization and added functions and modifiers for the templates to use.
- When a developer adds a remark, not only the user optionally gets an e-mail of that, but also all other developers interested in that comment.
- Many code and layout cleanups and bugfixes, including PHP notices, SQL injections, double escapes and XHTML errors.

Changes between LikeBack 1.1 and 1.0:
--------------------------------------
- Added LIKEBACK_DEBUG, LIKEBACK_PROJECT, LIKEBACK_VERSION and LIKEBACK_PRODUCTION configuration options.
- Added correct SQL placeholder handling in db.php, and made some queries SQL injection safe.
- Added Smarty templates support.
- Templatized the e-mails sent by LikeBack and improved the layout of those e-mails.
- Added the messages next to the status and type icons.
- Removed e-mail address links, developers should respond using LikeBack itself.
- Many bugfixes, including character set encoding issues and PHP notices.
