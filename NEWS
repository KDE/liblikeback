Changes between LikeBack 1.2 and 1.1:
--------------------------------------
- Added a script which is supposed to be run through cron, to send developers weekly reminders of unclosed comments.
- Added an application logo, preferences and login username box and LikeBack logo to the top bar.
- Added two new statuses: Thanks (about the same as Solved) and Wontfix (about the same as Invalid).
- Added version split code in send.php, so SVN releases become a lot easier to manage in the comment list on view.php.
- Added a real layout and useful information in stats.php and added a link in the header.
- Exported many more HTML pages to Smarty templates.
- E-mails sent by the application have more correct From, Sender and Reply-To headers.
- Fixed install.php to check if it should really install (is there not already a LikeBack table?)
- Moved code around to make it more logical: Ajax code in ajax.php and option saving code in options.php, not view.php.
- Streamlined Smarty initialization and added functions and modifiers for the templates to use.
- When a developer adds a remark, not only the user optionally gets an e-mail of that, but also all other developers interested in that comment.
- Many code and layout cleanups and bugfixes, including PHP notices, SQL injections, double escapes and XHTML errors.



Changes between LikeBack 1.1 and 1.0:
--------------------------------------
- Added LIKEBACK_DEBUG, LIKEBACK_PROJECT, LIKEBACK_VERSION and LIKEBACK_PRODUCTION configuration options.
- Added correct SQL placeholder handling in db.php, and made some queries SQL injection safe.
- Added Smarty templates support.
- Templatized the e-mails sent by LikeBack and improved the layout of those e-mails.
- Added the messages next to the status and type icons.
- Removed e-mail address links, developers should respond using LikeBack itself.
- Many bugfixes, including character set encoding issues and PHP notices.
