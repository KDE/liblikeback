 - Regarding Amarok 1f6b9e864bae6dde386398b064d10eea3ffe3873:
   We need a generic interface to set a list (or vector?) of objectNames for which no LikeBackBar is
   to be shown. This is in Amarok archvied by manually blacklisting names in
   LikeBackBar::changeWindow(), instead a foreach on some defined list (or vector?) should be
   performed.

+++ Pending Amarok Imports +++
 - 8c15fc58bd5c0825dc2573281d90baca99abae6c
    Debug++ in LikeBack
 - 3249e3799dcaed95a1677417d8989b6956689683
    Enabled bug reporting with LikeBack button + usual KDE KBugReport dialog. Replaced "improper behavior" icon with the usual KDE bug icon. Special bonus content: Fixed "Click here" in LikeBack to something more sane.
